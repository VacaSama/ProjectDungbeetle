# Project Dungbeetle - 

## Overview :

*Project Dungbeetle* helps programmers work through frustrating bugs
by giving them a place to explain what they’re trying to do, 
what’s going wrong, and why — no account or login required. By encouraging 
users to “talk it out” step-by-step, the app supports better debugging 
habits and helps turn confusing problems into clearer, solvable ones— 
reinforcing proven learning techniques like rubber-duck debugging and reflective problem solving. 

## Motivation and Goals for *Project Dungbeetle* :

Debugging is a critical skill for programmers, 
but it can also be one of the most frustrating and challenging aspects of coding.
Many developers struggle to effectively diagnose and resolve issues in their code, 
leading to wasted time and increased stress. 
Project Dungbeetle aims to address this problem by providing a simple, 
user-friendly platform where programmers can articulate their debugging process step-by-step.

## Features :

### Reflective Debugging 
- Log errors in your own words
- Capture the context, thoughts, and assumptions behind each bug
- Document how you approached the problem and what ultimately solved it

### Code Snippet Capture
- Paste code snippets that caused issues
- Keep problematic code and reflections together for future reference

### Pattern Tracking & Insight Building
- Identify recurring mistakes or debugging habits
- Notice trends in your problem‑solving style over time
- Strengthen self-awareness and confidence through consistent self-reflection
 
## Target Users :

 *Project Dungbeetle* is designed for: new programmers learning to debug, programmers 
 looking to improve their debugging skills, and instructors teaching debugging techniques.
